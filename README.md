# Logarithm-Recursive
Python math project. In this, we solve logarithm in math with recursive funtion in python.
In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation.
That means the logarithm of a number x to the base b is the exponent to which b must be raised, to produce x.
For example, since 1000 = 10 ** 3, the logarithm base 10 of 1000 is 3, or log10â€‰(1000) = 3
